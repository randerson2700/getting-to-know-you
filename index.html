                <p>
                    My name is Ryan Anderson. I am currently on my final semester at Lewis. I am  double majoring in Computer Engineering and Computer Science. 
                    I live with my parents along with my older brother and younger sister. I have a dog, his name is Gibson, and he's a boston terrier.

                    <p>
                        I hope to learn how professional development cycles work. I also hope to learn more about software development in general as well as learning how
                        to use multiple softwares to create one product.

                        <p>
                            My favorite hobby is probably going to the gym and lifting weights. I enjoy it because it makes me feel good and it allows me to better
                            myself. I also enjoy watching sports like MMA, baseball, and football. I am very excited to watch the Chicago Bears this year.
